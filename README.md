| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 6+               | 1-2               |  5 - 15 minutes      | 8 & Up           |

## Objective
Solve the puzzle by connecting Blinks together with like-colored sides.

In Solitaire (name TBD?) mode, the Blinks themselves generate a 6-Blink puzzle automatically.

In VS mode, one player assembles a puzzle with any amount of Blinks, then shuffles the Blinks and presents their puzzle to the other player.

## Setup
To switch between Solitaire and VS Puzzle, set all the Blinks to Setup mode, and bring them together. Long press one of them to switch between game modes. Setup mode for Solitaire is a dim white, which brightens as it has more neighbors. Setup mode for VS Puzzle is a mixture of orange, green, and magenta, and the lights change color as they connect to other Blinks.

### Solitaire
In this mode, bring together 6 Blinks in setup mode. When one Blink has 5 neighbors, it becomes eligible to generate a puzzle. It should look like this:

Double press the central Blink to begin the puzzle generation algorithm. The blinks will flash white, then countdown to completion by changing color. When it is complete, all Blinks will have red, yellow, and blue lights, and no remaining white lights. The puzzle is now ready to solve.

#### VS Puzzle
To create a VS Puzzle, bring together any number of Blinks in setup mode. As you make connections, the sides will be assigned colors automatically. Once you have all your Blinks connected, double click any of them. This will lock the colors in place, and allow you to shuffle the Blinks around on the play surface and present them to the other player to solve.

## Gameplay

Rearrange the Blinks so that red sides touch other red sides, yellow touch yellow, and so on. Sides with no light cannot have adjacent Blinks. You will know you have solved the puzzle when every colored light on every Blink is pulsing brightly.

To go back to setup mode, bring all the blinks together and double press one of them. This can be done whether you've solved the puzzle or not.
